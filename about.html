		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I have been creating art since I could pick up a pencil and have loved every second of it. I tend to seek out new forms of art to try or test out, always willing to learn and expand my artistic abilities. Luckily, my school district, my vocational program, and my parents have all helped to facilitate this goal. I hope to share my art with you for whatever project, program, small company, or personal use you wish to use it for!</p>
